# Welcome to the Studio Week 5!

Last week we focused on data sources for your maps and creating custom maps from the ground up. This week, we'll be continuing to look at data with a deep-dive into [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) or "OSM".

**What you will need:**
- an OSM account.
- a Github account for hosting website and data
- a Mapbox account.

## Expected Outputs for this week / what to submit:

As usual, you will submit a link to your Github repo and the working website that it hosts. There are no rules about the website other than it must contain a map using OSM data. You can design any style web map you like, using any of the techniques or technologies we've learned so far...

1. Map that uses hosted GeoJSON files for data.
2. Map that ...
3. A third?

# Accessing OSM Data
It's more than a map, it's a huge crowdsourced database! What you see on on the [OpenStreetMap homepage](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) - or other OSM tilesets for that matter - is a _selection_ of data availale in the OSM database.

For example, some people focus on features in the database related to [cycling](https://www.thunderforest.com/maps/opencyclemap/), while others focus on [humanitarian features](http://map.hotosm.org/#15/32.2916/36.3341). You can see [a list of OSM tiles here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles) and view a few of the different tiles on the OSM homepage under the *Layers* icon on the right side of the screen.
